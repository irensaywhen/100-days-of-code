# I'm starting my second round of #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Preface

Hello. My name is Irina, and I'm a fulltime freelance frontend developer.
**#100DaysOfCode** helped me to bring my coding skills onto next level during my first round, reach out great people, become a part of the community. 
I learned about 
- tooling and automation with *Gulp* and *Webpack*, 
- *Prettier* and *ESLint*, 
- *Sass*, 
- *Websockets and socket.io*, 
- *Nodejs* and *npm*,
- *Flask* and different template engines
- *MySQL*

It was a tough journey, especially because it was my first turn. I didn't spend much time on planning, nor keeped consistent log.
Now, I want to become even better developer, and do it in the most consistent way possible. 

Check my plans and goals for the current round!
