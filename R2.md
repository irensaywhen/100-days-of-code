# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Irina Gataullina

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 12, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1

###### Results 

- Started learning in-depth about approaches to cross-browser testing. 
Read articles from *MDN* about [cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
and started setting up **Selenium**
- Read the fourth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did the excersizes after this chapter
You can check my [repo](https://github.com/irensaywhen/secrets-of-javascript-ninja) where I commit my progress towards reading this book and figuring out the examples and excersizes.

###### Thoughts

I like the way John Resig explains JavaScript peculiarities. Today I eventually understood how the context of arrow functions
is being specified.
Also, I really appreciate that this book forces you to test your code. 
Thanks to te book, I eventually started figuring out some **Jest framwork** and unit testing basics 
(John Resig uses custom assertion method, but I want to start gaining testing experience with popular framework)
To be honest, I feel myself much more confident while performing some tests after writing code. 


### Day 2

###### Results 

- Started reading the fifth chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book, alost finished it (I left one, the most complicated topic of this chapter for tomorror). It was about execution context, lexical environment, and differences between variables declaration in JavaScript. I was already partially familiar with these topics before as I had read "JavaScript Modern Tutorial Book", but John Resig explained it in more structured way which helped me wrap my head around these complex topics. 
- Setup Selenium testing project and strted figuring out WebDrivers. 

###### Thoughts

It's always a painful process of making things work (especially in windows). It took time to set PATH varialbe and make it work in VSCode terminal. (Only after full restart LOL). Also, I'm not sure about when it's worth time to use Selenium, and when to perform manual testing, but I'll figure that out soon (At the very least, I hope). 

### Day 3

###### Results 

Finished the fifth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did all the exercises after it. Started writing tests for the first JavaScript project of fcc JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. 

###### Thoughts

It was quite a short day of code when I didn't do much. But I decided that while reading, I want to have some practice, too. So I got my hand dirty with the JavaScript certification of freeCodeCamp

### Day 4

###### Results 

I've finished the first two challenges of Algorithms and Data structures.I decided not only to use the fcc testing system, but also write test using Jest, and resolve the challenges locally before commiting them to the fcc. 

###### Links to work

- **Palinrome Checker**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/palindrome-checker
- **Roman Numeral Converter**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/roman-numeral-converter

###### Thoughts

While Palindrome Checker was quite an easy challenge, Roman Converter wasn't. I didn't know before how to convert big numbers, so it took time to wrap my head around it. 
In this challenge, I had space to practice with stack data structure, as I was using it to store combinations of numbers. 

### Day 5

##### Results

Continuing reading the book. Chapter 6 is about Promises and Generators. While Promises is a relatively covered concept for me, Generators are not. Tried out some examples and made a random number generator using generator function. 

### Day 6

##### Results

Today I figured out deboucing and implemented it in my freelance project. In the evening, I continued figuring out generators and promises. I've figured out how's javascript dealing with generator's execution context, and why it is possible to resume the execution of generator functions. Also, passed through the Promises.
Figured out how to test async code using Jest framework in order to test the function from the book which retrieves data from a server (Used JSON placeholder API for that)

### Day 7

##### Results

- I've read a part of "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book. Finished the chapter about Promises and generators, and started the next one, which is about prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript. I'd already met these concepts, so it was pretty easy to grasp.
- Started figuring out how to build blog with Jekyll, and followed the tutorial on Jekyll oficial site. 

###### Links to work
The sample [jekyll blog](https://github.com/irensaywhen/jerkyll-blog)

### Day 8

##### Results

Finished the 7th Chapter in the book about prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. Thing that was new to me is how instanceof operator works. (Gets the function's prototype on the right and checks whether it is presented in the prototypal chain of the object on the left).

### Day 9

##### Results

Went through the 8th Chapter of the book. It was about controlling access using getters, setters, and proxies. 
Things I've learned today: 
- How to mimic truly private properties using variables and Object.defineProperty inside constuctor.
- What the proxy is
- How to use proxies for logging
- How to use proxies to measure perfomance
- How to validate properties using proxies
- How to implement negative array indexes using proxies
- And... The big downside of using proxies - its bad perfomance. I've measured the time of function executions, and, as it turns out, accessing an array through proxies is approximately 30 times slower in Node.js than accessing an array directly. 

### Day 10

###### Results 

I've started building my blog with Jekyll. I've decided to establish the workflow first, so I've started with figuring out GitHub actions. It took a while to grasp the concept and make everything right, but now it works.

- [Actual site](https://irensaywhen.github.io/iren-says-blog/)

### Day 11

###### Results 

Today I continued reading the 'Secrets of JavaScript Ninja' book. 
New things I've learned: 
- How to elegantly reuse built-in array methods to mimic array behavior
- Why objects are not the best solution to handle mapping
- How to use Maps

### Days 12-14

###### Results

Continue building my blog. A lot of things is going on there. I've learned how to customize bootstrap 4 source code, and it is an amazing feeling when you need to change variable values instead of overwriting classes. Also, I've prepared the menu for mobile, posts list on the main page, and the main navigation menu.

### Day 15

###### Results

Today is all about git and figuring out how to setup Travis CI. I learned several new things during it: 
- The general idea behid automatic deployment
- How to disable GitHub actions
- How to configure Travis CI and write basic scripts for it
- Some new Git commands as I needed to remoge Gemfile.lock from git index and get rid of main branch to switch to master

### Day 16

###### Results

- Almost figured out how to use *relative_link* liquid filter to output links
- Some other filters such as *capture*, *slugify* *append:*, and *prepend:*
- Integrated *jekyll-archives* plugin
- Added tags to posts

### Day 17

###### Results

- Added pagination on the main page using jekyll-paginate-v2
- Started exploring how to add the same thing on category and tag pages by checking a theme where it is done

### Day 18

###### Results

- Customized bootstrap grid to display posts in a way I like more.
- Prepared post page
- figured out how to display related posts on the post page.  Not via Jekyll related_posts function, but by tags to make them actually related
- Started planning a 404 page 

### Day 19

###### Results

- Finished the 9th Chapter of "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book. It was about sets, so I learned how Sets can be mimic,
and how to use the real ones from ES6. I figured out how to perform actions such as intersection, difference, and union with them using spread operator and array's filter method. 
- Added tweet button on my blog

### Day 20

###### Results

- Added pagination on tags and category pages with jekyll-paginate-v2
  Turns out I even didn't needed jekyll-archives. 
- Started building about page. I want to make it outstanding, so I've started adding parallax effects and experimenting with transformations.

### Days 21 - 22

###### Results

I decided to figure out how to run jekyll from gulp (as I've got extremely tired of reloading browser). For that, I started learning some basics about node streams and child_process module. In a short node.js course, I've learned: 
- Why require/exports work as a module dependancy system
- Require's caching
- How to use ES6 modules in node (through package.json configuration)
- Dynamic imports

### Day 23

###### Results

I've eventually run jekyll from gulp using child_process. Meanwhile, I learned a couple of things: 
- Types of node.js streams
- Some EventEmitter basics
- How to use child_process.spawn
- Windows cannot run command directly, only through *.bat 
- Even using liquid template engine, I need to wrap attributes into quotes. Otherwise, browser may interpret closing slash as a part of src.

### Days 24 - 26

###### Results

- Eventually figured out the differencies between art direction using <picture> and <source> attribute, 
- Using intersection observer and css filters, made aboutpage more entertaining
- Almost finished the footer

 - Prepared everything to show different images for sharing on social media, in post previews, and in actual post
 
 ### Day 28
 
 ###### Results
 
 - Created custom 404 page for my blog
 - Fixed layout issues
 - Spent decent amount of time figuring out how to handle seo meta tags in jekyll, even if it requires three lines of code

### Day 29

###### Results

- Eventually finished my blog
- Started a React cource on fcc youtube channel by John Smilga. In that, 
I learned: 
    - How to start new app with create-react-app
    - Some basics about funcitonal components
    - Basics of JSX
    - How to apply styles to JSX via classes and inline styles 
    - How to write javascript inside JSX
    - About props and children props
    - How to pass props into component using spread operator
    - Basics of event handling 
    - How to split app into different files
    
With all that, I've made my first very simple react page

### Day 30

###### Results

Continuing my React journey. Today I learned about: 
- Class components
- How to set and change the state using setState
- General idea behind lifecycle methods
- How to use componentDidMount lifecycle method to fetch data from an API before rendering component
- Conditional rendering
With all that, I've made a simple todo app

### Day 31

###### Results

After figuring out some additional concepts, I started building my first app with React. I've spent decent amount of time on choosing a simple API to utilize for this purpose, and decided to stick with the dumdest thoughts by Donald Trump

###### Links to work
[Thoughts by Donald Trump](https://donald-trump-thoughts.netlify.app/)

### Day 32

###### Results

- Wrapped my head around controlled components in React
- Figured out different approaches to pass methods around components 
- Started utilizing CSS modules
- Figured out how styled components work
- Learned about tagged literals
- Almost finished my quotes generator for Donald Trump thoughts. I need to make it more responsive, but it's working. I'm utilizing ComponentDidMount lifecycle hook to grap all the topics from the API and show them, and then additional API calls to get quotes by topic, or get a single random quote

### Day 33

###### Results

Diving deeper into more advanced React topics.
- Lifecycle hooks
- Utilizing useEffect in functional components
- The Virual DOM concept in React
- How to use shouldComponentUpdate to optimize perfomance
- Differencies between Component and PureComponent
- Utilizing React.memo for functional components
- Got some ideas about Higher Order Components
- Figured out how react updates the real DOM


###### Thoughts

I really appreciate that the course I'm taking put an effort into explaining more in-depth concepts. It's extremely important to understand how things work. Combining this course with some experiments and documentation helps me to grasp these more advanced topics.

### Day 34

###### Results

There's plenty of new things I've figured out:
- Refs
- Context API and useContext hook
- Two ways of writing custom higher order components
Started building the course project - it will be a burger builder.

### Day 35

###### Results

Keep doing my project along the course. Added controls to dynamically build a burger. I guess I should host it on Netlify to show progress along the way so that everyone can try it

### Day 36

###### Results

Keep working on the course project. Added modal to confirm checkout, and started working on header. React is an amazingly enjoyable tool to make projects with, and CSS modules make life way easier.

### Day 37

###### Results

I've almost finished the main UI elements of the burger builder. It has a nice mobile menu, header on desktop, build controls and a modal with order summary now. It's time to optimize things a bit.

### Day 38

###### Results

It was almost all about axios.
- GET, POST, DELETE
- Interceptors
- Error handling
- Managing defaults using axios instances
Then some firebase. 
And, after experiments and examples preparations, I finished my first post!

### Day 39

###### Results

Done some firebase, request sending, and error handling with axios. The day was a mess because of problems with git and windows, I've spent the whole day trying to fix filename incompatible with windows filesystem. This https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63727594/github-git-checkout-returns-error-invalid-path-on-windows saved me

### Day 40

###### Results

Started playing around with the react router. It's something I need to wrap my head around, as planning nested routes and displaying multiple of them is something nontrivial.  
Yet another magical concept disappeared from my life.

### Day 41

###### Results

Passed an assignment in my course for routing part, finished the section about routing, and started implementing it in the burger project. Learned about using react. lazy, it's entertaining to see how browser loading chunks in chrome network tab.

### Day 42

###### Results

Didn't do any React, but prepared examples for my next article, which is going to be about a banal topic in JavaScript - this keyword. I'm trying an approach to explain it in a different manner so that it makes more sense rather than memorizing

### Day 43

###### Results

Finished adding routing to the burger project. Also thinking about a real project I want to build after finishing the course.

### Day 44

###### Results

Figured out form handling with React, and started with redux. It's something you need to get used to, but the overall concept is very clean. Also, continued working on my blog post about "this" in javascript.

### Day 45

###### Results

Getting my handing dirty with redux. I've converted a simple demo project managing state in a class-based component so that it utilizes redux. Searching for a bug for ~an hour before realizing I'm not returning state in a reducer 

### Day 46

###### Results

Implemented basic redux into the course project, and divided into more advanced concepts. Holy moly, there's a lot of things going on. Middlewares, action creators, handling async code with redux-thunk. Such a big family

### Day 47

###### Results

Added redux to the course project. Getting used to project structure with redux, but still confused with tons of files I need to maintain store also started a section about authentication. I have a question though, do you use JWT in you apps for it?

### Day 48

###### Results

Started working with JWT in firebase and React. Still confused a bit with the big redux family I need to maintain to handle the store. Every time when I need to get a new thing from it, I feel it's hundreds miles away

### Day 49

###### Results

Haven't done any React during the day. Instead, focused on writing my article. Have written some examples of the peculiar behavior of "this" in JavaScrit. Actually, my article is almost done, and I'm planning to finish it today. Hope you'll enjoy it.

Finished my demo react app in the course. With that, I've started figuring out how to deal with React testing with Jest and Enzyme. I have a question meanwhile, how to learn automated testing in general? Concepts, approaches, etc

### Day 50

###### Results

I've started my passion project with react eventually. I want to build an app where you can discover music influences. Also got into Tailwind CSS, and I like it way more than bootstrap, as it provides low-level utilities instead of components.

### Day 51

###### Results

Spent some time with my new child - influences app. Prepared the color scheme and the layout for displaying influences lists, and added swiper to my project. Using it with react is much more straightforward than with classic websites to be honest 

### Day 52

###### Results

Day was full of struggle. Firstly, apple didn't allow me to enter my account, then said that I can't use their dev account for free. Fuck it. Lost 4 hrs on it. Then struggled with understanding of how to add oauth2 into react project. Still have no clue

### Day 53

###### Results

I've decided to understand what OAuth2 is about, and I've found an amazing 1-hour explanation on that topic be 
okta
 
it reminded me of the times when I was in university, on tech lectures. Damn, I love to study the theory behind things

### Day 54

###### Results

Moved forward a lot with my music project. Integrated Genius API about which I'm planning to write an article, and almost finished the search for artists. Also finished my article about "this" keyword in javascript - check it out!

### Day 55

###### Results

After some experiments with Genius API (which doesn't have very extensive docs tbh) I found out that perhaps it'll be better to use Spotify API. I figured out how to start using it from my app, and started working on authentication flow

### Day 56

###### Results

To use Spotify API with React, I figured out a bit of Netlify lambda functions to make requests without exposing my client secret. I'm extremely impressed with the fact all that possible WITHOUT a real backend server you need to maintain.

### Day 57

###### Results

I needed to figure out some Webpack stuff for my freelance project. 
Webpack 5 has VERY WEIRD behavior with the SplitChunks plugin I tell you that. I ended up returning to Webpack 4. 
Also discovered webpack-bundle-analyzer which is awesome

### Day 58

###### Results

Felt tired, so spent most of the day on ui of my app. In the evening, started with react, and prepared some button styles with tailwind css, as well as modal component
I hope in the next day I'll feel better and be able to start developing signup flow.

### Day 59

###### Results

As always, there are laundry lists of things you should know when building something real for the first time figuring out forms with formik and yup. It's fun how difficult it is to deliver a delightful user experience in such common things as forms

### Day 60

###### Results

For some reason I feel a bit tired of pushing my project every day. Even though I added formik and yup to signup form, it doesn't bring satisfaction as I used to feel. Maybe I need to learn something meanwhile to not to burn out and drop my ideas off

### Day 61

###### Results

To switch a bit from my project and refresh my enthusiasm, I decided to give the new php course on traversy media channel a shot. In my freelance project I'm working in laravel environment so it's interesting for me to dive a bit into server-side stuff

### Day 62

###### Results

Still a bit demotivated to get back to my project, so keep exploring php. Its syntax is very similar to JavaScript, so it's easy to quickly grasp things

### Day 63

###### Results

Gave jsdocs a try. In the Traversy Media crash course everything worked perfectly but in my project WITH THE SAME CONFIG except folder name (I changed it in config, not that stupid) it cannot find files, wtf? Does anyone know a remedy?

### Day 64

###### Results

Explored jsdoc3 and figured out an issue with missed files - there's a bug with pattern. I'm still a bit confused by how jsdoc treats namespaces and how to use it properly, but it should come to me with practice I GUESS

### Day 65

###### Results

I kinda keep exploring php, this time it was about dates, splitting code into files, and some oop. I'll get to my project and my blog when the holidays will start, as now I feel very tired to do that after work or something.

### Day 66

###### Results

I'm slowly getting back to code, needed some time to overcome the burnout and stuff. I continued the PHP course, and in that course, I've started working with a database through PDO. Since it's holidays in Russia, perhaps I'll miss some days though.

### Day 67

###### Results

Finished building the simplest version of the crud app and started refactoring to make it more manageable. Still feeling slight burnout that I need to overcome, so I'm not pushing myself too much every day

### Days 68 - 69

###### Results

Didn't spend much time on code during holidays. Reflecting about what I do write or wrong. Yet figured out namespaces and autoloading in php. At least grasped the main consepts of it. Started to implement mini mvc framework with the course.

### Day 70

###### Results

New year, new approach. I spent decent amount of time thinking of avoiding the burnout in the next year. So I'm going to learn two code things simultaneously, spending the same amount of time on each. And I started laravel on laracasts alongside react.

### Day 71

###### Results

Was a laravel day. Started exploring how to work with models and make migrations. Started integrating a template and displaying posts from the database. Played around with tinker. A bit confused of interacting with eloquent.

### Day 72

###### Results

Continuing with laravel. Started making requests with forms, and learned about approaches to handle crud operations as well as best practices for it. Started figuring out how to deal with backend validation in laravel as well.

### Day 73

###### Results

Figured out a bit how to fake data with faker and factories and laravel, and started digging deeper into database stuff - relationships and integrity. 
CalebCurry is my saver again, his videos on theoretical topics are the best! 

### Day 74

###### Results

Figured out M:M relationships, and how to build them with laravel. Added tags to posts. Feel like I'll need more database training alongside the laravel course. How much time do people spend on learning about databases before building something?

### Day 75

###### Results

Got myself back to React and started figuring out hooks. It's was a more in-depth trip to useState. Meanwhile, encountered term synthetic events and read about it a bit. Quite interesting that react is built upon them, and that they're being reused.

### Day 76

###### Results

Started figuring out and applying useEffect hook. Tbh, it's VERY mysterious. I came up with an issue when it asks me to add prop's function as a dependency, and then enters infinite re-render cycle! Should I do it anyway? The documentation says yes...

### Day 77

###### Results

Was a day dedicated to database theory. Figured out a bit database normalization and how to approach it. For me it's kinda a revelation that you can think about entities and it's attributes rather than about rows, columns etc.

### Day 78

###### Results

Learned about useCallback and useReducer. Still a bit confused about useEffect. I found out that I can wrap my handlers in parent component into useCallback, however it's still some extra lines of code just to say to react that you can cache this function

### Day 79

###### Results

Was a laravel and php day. I learned a bit about how laravel helps you handle user login, signup, and forgot password flow. A lot of things are going on behind the scenes! I tried to look a bit into source code and realized that I need some OOP training

### Day 80

###### Results

Done some oop in php *php haters are coming* I believe it's important as I want to understand what's going on laravel behind the scenes. It's a huge framework, and as you dig deeper, it's almost impossible to remember everything without understanding

### Day 81

###### Results

Was a day for React. Figured out useContext hook and started writing my own hook for http requests. 
Using useContext is much more elegant way of using Context Api in React as I can see. Maybe it's true, classes are not that great in JavaScript

### Day 82

###### Results

Was kinda intense day. Started with web workers and wasn't able to do a simple 'Hello world' exchange (still haven't got an idea why an error occurs)
Started exploring what library to use with react when I want to make things quickly nice-looking

### Days 83 - 84

###### Results

Started new project with react. Trying to use bulma for styling (it was he time to try something new). It will be related to my driving school as we have a project on theory, and I want to make it interactive. Made a basic scaffold and navbar

### Day 85

###### Results

Very tense day. Spent some time on react and bulma building the home page for my project. Figured out how to recursively traverse objects. Made web workers do some heavy computations. Probably I should write an article about one of those topics

### Day 86

###### Results

I was focused on the theoretical project for my driving school with react. I'm making a wiki about a particular car model. Made a reference for warning lights on the dashboard, at least the first version of it. Try to build reusable components with bulma

### Day 87

###### Results

Finished a page with galleries containing cards about symbols on car dashboard. I'll think how to showcase it a little bit later. Spent decent amount of time thinking of organizing styling with bulma and some custom scss. Modules doesn't fit well

### Day 88

###### Results

After a couple days of due to my birthday I continued working on my react project. I had hard time figuring out why nested routes are not working (it's fine now). Also meanwhile learned a bit about how to implement a decorator for caching in vanilla js.

### Day 89

###### Results

Started building an accordion with bulma and react for my project. It's kinda work however I wanted to add some animations to it, so I spent some time to check how to handle animations with transition group. 
Meanwhile started an article about recursion

### Day 90

###### Results

Struggled wit ah smooth accordion animation in react. Tbh I don't know why it should be so difficult. it still slides adruptly for the reason without explanation 
I tried to do it with min-height property and transition group. Hope to find the solution

### Day 91

###### Results

Keep pushing my react project. It's quite hard to produce both the content and the code for it. Meanwhile I spent decent amount of time on uppy library for my freelance project, and it seems very nice. In a sense I like it more than filepond.

### Day 92

###### Results

Was working on the react project for driving school. Started using Context API and useContext hook to handle modals. I'm moving pretty slow as I'm trying to make content alongside development, and sometimes I spend time on refactoring

### Day 93

###### Results

Feeling kinda tired of work and my own projects, however, trying to push it. It's really hard sometimes to find motivation to do things when you do them every single day. Being a self-taught, I always remind myself that it's my responsibility

### Day 94

###### Results

Doing my react project, whiting a blog post about recursion. I'll split it up a bit, so one post will be a more theoretical, while the other one - more practical. By the way, have you heard about a teapot principle? idk if it's an international joke

### Day 95

###### Results

Was jumping between the freelance and personal project all the day which made my head burn.
Is it possible at all that laravel has a bug only on test development domain when I don't interact with urls? Just making a request and passing data around

### Day 96

###### Results

I'm in a rush with my main freelance project, still trying to find time for the React project as well as it's related to my driving school, and has a deadline too

### Day 97

###### Results

Almost there! Spent some time on the react project, mostly producing the content according to my project's requirements.
Eventually added a form to my blog, yet didn't polished the ui so it's crappy so far

### Day 98

###### Results

Doing some refactoring to utilize useContext in my driving school project. Also made some small visual improvements to it such as picked the right front, adjust se global color styling, etc. 
Do you customize css frameworks when you use them?

### Day 99

###### Results

Crunch in the end of a long project is unavoidable, yet I'm keep building the driving school project. Today it was all about the animations, microinteractions, and small visual improvements which I was delaying for a while.

### Day 100

###### Results

 I compared react-transition-group's approach to animate routes with react-router-transition (which is based on react motion) and lover the former. 
Why? Because the latter is a more high-level approach without an ability to fine-tune things.
