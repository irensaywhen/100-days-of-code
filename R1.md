# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Irina Gataullina

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 12, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 

###### Results 

- Started learning in-depth about approaches to cross-browser testing. 
Read articles from *MDN* about [cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
and started setting up **Selenium**
- Read the fourth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did the excersizes after this chapter
You can check my [repo](https://github.com/irensaywhen/secrets-of-javascript-ninja) where I commit my progress towards reading this book and figuring out the examples and excersizes.

###### Thoughts

I like the way John Resig explains JavaScript peculiarities. Today I eventually understood how the context of arrow functions
is being specified.
Also, I really appreciate that this book forces you to test your code. 
Thanks to te book, I eventually started figuring out some **Jest framwork** and unit testing basics 
(John Resig uses custom assertion method, but I want to start gaining testing experience with popular framework)
To be honest, I feel myself much more confident while performing some tests after writing code. 


### R1D2

###### Results 

- Started reading the fifth chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book, alost finished it (I left one, the most complicated topic of this chapter for tomorror). It was about execution context, lexical environment, and differences between variables declaration in JavaScript. I was already partially familiar with these topics before as I had read "JavaScript Modern Tutorial Book", but John Resig explained it in more structured way which helped me wrap my head around these complex topics. 
- Setup Selenium testing project and strted figuring out WebDrivers. 

###### Thoughts

It's always a painful process of making things work (especially in windows). It took time to set PATH varialbe and make it work in VSCode terminal. (Only after full restart LOL). Also, I'm not sure about when it's worth time to use Selenium, and when to perform manual testing, but I'll figure that out soon (At the very least, I hope). 

### R1D3

###### Results 

Finished the fifth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did all the exercises after it. Started writing tests for the first JavaScript project of fcc JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. 

###### Thoughts

It was quite a short day of code when I didn't do much. But I decided that while reading, I want to have some practice, too. So I got my hand dirty with the JavaScript certification of freeCodeCamp

### R1D4

###### Results 

I've finished the first two challenges of Algorithms and Data structures.I decided not only to use the fcc testing system, but also write test using Jest, and resolve the challenges locally before commiting them to the fcc. 

###### Links to work

- **Palinrome Checker**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/palindrome-checker
- **Roman Numeral Converter**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/roman-numeral-converter

###### Thoughts

While Palindrome Checker was quite an easy challenge, Roman Converter wasn't. I didn't know before how to convert big numbers, so it took time to wrap my head around it. 
In this challenge, I had space to practice with stack data structure, as I was using it to store combinations of numbers. 

### R1D5

##### Results

Continuing reading the book. Chapter 6 is about Promises and Generators. While Promises is a relatively covered concept for me, Generators are not. Tried out some examples and made a random number generator using generator function. 

### R1D6

##### Results

Today I figured out deboucing and implemented it in my freelance project. In the evening, I continued figuring out generators and promises. I've figured out how's javascript dealing with generator's execution context, and why it is possible to resume the execution of generator functions. Also, passed through the Promises.
Figured out how to test async code using Jest framework in order to test the function from the book which retrieves data from a server (Used JSON placeholder API for that)
