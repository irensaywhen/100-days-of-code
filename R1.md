The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 12, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 

###### Results 

- Started learning in-depth about approaches to cross-browser testing. 
Read articles from *MDN* about [cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
and started setting up **Selenium**
- Read the fourth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did the excersizes after this chapter
You can check my [repo](https://github.com/irensaywhen/secrets-of-javascript-ninja) where I commit my progress towards reading this book and figuring out the examples and excersizes.

###### Thoughts

I like the way John Resig explains JavaScript peculiarities. Today I eventually understood how the context of arrow functions
is being specified.
Also, I really appreciate that this book forces you to test your code. 
Thanks to te book, I eventually started figuring out some **Jest framwork** and unit testing basics 
(John Resig uses custom assertion method, but I want to start gaining testing experience with popular framework)
To be honest, I feel myself much more confident while performing some tests after writing code.
