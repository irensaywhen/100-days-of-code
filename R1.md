# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Irina Gataullina

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 12, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 

###### Results 

- Started learning in-depth about approaches to cross-browser testing. 
Read articles from *MDN* about [cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
and started setting up **Selenium**
- Read the fourth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did the excersizes after this chapter
You can check my [repo](https://github.com/irensaywhen/secrets-of-javascript-ninja) where I commit my progress towards reading this book and figuring out the examples and excersizes.

###### Thoughts

I like the way John Resig explains JavaScript peculiarities. Today I eventually understood how the context of arrow functions
is being specified.
Also, I really appreciate that this book forces you to test your code. 
Thanks to te book, I eventually started figuring out some **Jest framwork** and unit testing basics 
(John Resig uses custom assertion method, but I want to start gaining testing experience with popular framework)
To be honest, I feel myself much more confident while performing some tests after writing code. 


### R1D2

###### Results 

- Started reading the fifth chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book, alost finished it (I left one, the most complicated topic of this chapter for tomorror). It was about execution context, lexical environment, and differences between variables declaration in JavaScript. I was already partially familiar with these topics before as I had read "JavaScript Modern Tutorial Book", but John Resig explained it in more structured way which helped me wrap my head around these complex topics. 
- Setup Selenium testing project and strted figuring out WebDrivers. 

###### Thoughts

It's always a painful process of making things work (especially in windows). It took time to set PATH varialbe and make it work in VSCode terminal. (Only after full restart LOL). Also, I'm not sure about when it's worth time to use Selenium, and when to perform manual testing, but I'll figure that out soon (At the very least, I hope). 

### R1D3

###### Results 

Finished the fifth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did all the exercises after it. Started writing tests for the first JavaScript project of fcc JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. 

###### Thoughts

It was quite a short day of code when I didn't do much. But I decided that while reading, I want to have some practice, too. So I got my hand dirty with the JavaScript certification of freeCodeCamp

### R1D4

###### Results 

I've finished the first two challenges of Algorithms and Data structures.I decided not only to use the fcc testing system, but also write test using Jest, and resolve the challenges locally before commiting them to the fcc. 

###### Links to work

- **Palinrome Checker**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/palindrome-checker
- **Roman Numeral Converter**: https://github.com/irensaywhen/roman-numeral-converter

###### Thoughts

While Palindrome Checker was quite an easy challenge, Roman Converter wasn't. I didn't know before how to convert big numbers, so it took time to wrap my head around it. 
In this challenge, I had space to practice with stack data structure, as I was using it to store combinations of numbers. 

### R1D5

##### Results

Continuing reading the book. Chapter 6 is about Promises and Generators. While Promises is a relatively covered concept for me, Generators are not. Tried out some examples and made a random number generator using generator function. 

### R1D6

##### Results

Today I figured out deboucing and implemented it in my freelance project. In the evening, I continued figuring out generators and promises. I've figured out how's javascript dealing with generator's execution context, and why it is possible to resume the execution of generator functions. Also, passed through the Promises.
Figured out how to test async code using Jest framework in order to test the function from the book which retrieves data from a server (Used JSON placeholder API for that)

### R1D7

##### Results

- I've read a part of "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book. Finished the chapter about Promises and generators, and started the next one, which is about prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript. I'd already met these concepts, so it was pretty easy to grasp.
- Started figuring out how to build blog with Jekyll, and followed the tutorial on Jekyll oficial site.

### R1D8

##### Results

Finished the 7th Chapter in the book about prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. Thing that was new to me is how instanceof operator works. (Gets the function's prototype on the right and checks whether it is presented in the prototypal chain of the object on the left).

### R1D9

##### Results

Went through the 8th Chapter of the book. It was about controlling access using getters, setters, and proxies. 
Things I've learned today: 
- How to mimic truly private properties using variables and Object.defineProperty inside constuctor.
- What the proxy is
- How to use proxies for logging
- How to use proxies to measure perfomance
- How to validate properties using proxies
- How to implement negative array indexes using proxies
- And... The big downside of using proxies - its bad perfomance. I've measured the time of function executions, and, as it turns out, accessing an array through proxies is approximately 30 times slower in Node.js than accessing an array directly. 

### R1D10

###### Results 

I've started building my blog with Jekyll. I've decided to establish the workflow first, so I've started with figuring out GitHub actions. It took a while to grasp the concept and make everything right, but now it works.

### R1D12

###### Results 

Today I continued reading the 'Secrets of JavaScript Ninja' book. 
New things I've learned: 
- How to elegantly reuse built-in array methods to mimic array behavior
- Why objects are not the best solution to handle mapping
- How to use Maps

### R1D13-14

###### Results

Continue building my blog. A lot of things is going on there. I've learned how to customize bootstrap 4 source code, and it is an amazing feeling when you need to change variable values instead of overwriting classes. Also, I've prepared the menu for mobile, posts list on the main page, and the main navigation menu.

### R1D15

###### Results

Today is all about git and figuring out how to setup Travis CI. I learned several new things during it: 
- The general idea behid automatic deployment
- How to disable GitHub actions
- How to configure Travis CI and write basic scripts for it
- Some new Git commands as I needed to remoge Gemfile.lock from git index and get rid of main branch to switch to master

### R1D16

###### Results

- Almost figured out how to use *relative_link* liquid filter to output links
- Some other filters such as *capture*, *slugify* *append:*, and *prepend:*
- Integrated *jekyll-archives* plugin
- Added tags to posts

### R1D17

###### Results

- Added pagination on the main page using jekyll-paginate-v2
- Started exploring how to add the same thing on category and tag pages by checking a theme where it is done

### R1D18

###### Results

- Customized bootstrap grid to display posts in a way I like more.
- Prepared post page
- figured out how to display related posts on the post page.  Not via Jekyll related_posts function, but by tags to make them actually related
- Started planning a 404 page 

### R1D19

###### Results

- Finished the 9th Chapter of "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book. It was about sets, so I learned how Sets can be mimic,
and how to use the real ones from ES6. I figured out how to perform actions such as intersection, difference, and union with them using spread operator and array's filter method. 
- Added tweet button on my blog

### R1D20

###### Results

- Added pagination on tags and category pages with jekyll-paginate-v2
  Turns out I even didn't needed jekyll-archives. 
- Started building about page. I want to make it outstanding, so I've started adding parallax effects and experimenting with transformations.

### R1D21-22

###### Results

I decided to figure out how to run jekyll from gulp (as I've got extremely tired of reloading browser). For that, I started learning some basics about node streams and child_process module. In a short node.js course, I've learned: 
- Why require/exports work as a module dependancy system
- Require's caching
- How to use ES6 modules in node (through package.json configuration)
- Dynamic imports

### R1D23

###### Results

I've eventually run jekyll from gulp using child_process. Meanwhile, I learned a couple of things: 
- Types of node.js streams
- Some EventEmitter basics
- How to use child_process.spawn
- Windows cannot run command directly, only through *.bat 
- Even using liquid template engine, I need to wrap attributes into quotes. Otherwise, browser may interpret closing slash as a part of src.

### R1D24-26

###### Results

- Eventually figured out the differencies between art direction using <picture> and <source> attribute, 
- Using intersection observer and css filters, made aboutpage more entertaining
