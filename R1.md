## Log

### R1D1 

###### Results 

- Started learning in-depth about approaches to cross-browser testing. 
Read articles from *MDN* about [cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
and started setting up **Selenium**
- Read the fourth Chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book and did the excersizes after this chapter
You can check my [repo](https://github.com/irensaywhen/secrets-of-javascript-ninja) where I commit my progress towards reading this book and figuring out the examples and excersizes.

###### Thoughts

I like the way John Resig explains JavaScript peculiarities. Today I eventually understood how the context of arrow functions
is being specified.
Also, I really appreciate that this book forces you to test your code. 
Thanks to te book, I eventually started figuring out some **Jest framwork** and unit testing basics 
(John Resig uses custom assertion method, but I want to start gaining testing experience with popular framework)
To be honest, I feel myself much more confident while performing some tests after writing code. 


### R1D2

###### Results 

- Started reading the fifth chapter of the "Secrets of JavaScript Ninja" book, alost finished it (I left one, the most complicated topic of this chapter for tomorror). It was about execution context, lexical environment, and differences between variables declaration in JavaScript. I was already partially familiar with these topics before as I had read "JavaScript Modern Tutorial Book", but John Resig explained it in more structured way which helped me wrap my head around these complex topics. 
- Setup Selenium testing project and strted figuring out WebDrivers. 

###### Thoughts

It's always a painful process of making things work (especially in windows). It took time to set PATH varialbe and make it work in VSCode terminal. (Only after full restart LOL). Also, I'm not sure about when it's worth time to use Selenium, and when to perform manual testing, but I'll figure that out soon (At the very least, I hope).
